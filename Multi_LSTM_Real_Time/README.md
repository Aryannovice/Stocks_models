All the rights belong to me apart from the kaggle user who did the visualization part 
, Models are mine and in case you wish to directly copy it , try deepseek or chatgpt to tune in the models further 
, maybe in future some new models are there

I have used real time data and as per my observations on majority multi layer LSTM was better but in few cases RNN did quite well 
maybe thats why quant models are at a high now .
